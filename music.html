        <h4>Single: Fear (2022)</h4>
        <p class="padded-5">"The message is a simple one; face your fears. Everything I value that I have ever achieved in my life has been on the other side of my own insecurity and uncertainty. We may never really shake off our anxieties completely but realising we have the power to face them and overcome them has been so important in shaping the experiences that have helped me to grow.
            It is by far my favourite song to play live and acts as a constant reminder to keep pushing on every step of the way since I wrote it. I hope you will find some strength in the song too." The 10th-anniversary new version single of Fear will officially be released in October 2022</p>
