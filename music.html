        <p class="padded-t">VTKTM was founded by Ryan Inglis and Chet Harding after a collaboration in the studio circa 2010.
            Bringing together Chet's passion for rap, and Ryan's for guitar riffs, it became a combo that had already been experimented with to great success with bands like Rage Against The Machine and Ice-T's Body Count. Frontman Chet's infectious vocal and their level of energy is palpable and while they flirt with a 'sound' of a genre they are in so many ways completely unique.
