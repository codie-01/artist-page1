    <h3 class="padded"> New Single: Rubik's Cube </h3>

    <p class="padded">The follow-up to his last singles "Only Human", "Munich" and "Blessed With Less" which all gained significant airplay in Germany, Switzerland, Austria & Italy is due for release on 29th July 2022.
        <br><br>
        The song, "Rubiks Cube", lyrically compares the confusing actions of certain people in your life with the comparable difficulty in solving a Rubik's cube; Just as you think you've figured someone out they change again just as quickly. Although the subject matter may seem serious it's a fun, upbeat and funky song mixed & produced together with Luke Potter, one of Ryan's closest friends.
