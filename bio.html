        <p class="padded-t">British full-time musician Ryan Inglis has published three studio albums, two as a solo-artist called '7 Blank Tiles' (2009) and 'The Time Is Now' (2013) and one with his Rap-Rock-Band 'Visions To Kill' called 'BEAST' (2017), which are all available on music platforms such as iTunes, Spotify and Amazon Music.
        <br><br>
        Ryan spent most of his early adult years in the small seaside town of Weston-super-Mare near Bristol, England.
        He taught himself to play the guitar from the age of 16 and started teaching privately in his local area at 18. Later at 22, he became a regular live performer on stages in his home town of Weston-super-Mare. By 2006 he had made music his full-time occupation.â€‹
        <br><br>
        Today, he is an independent singer-songwriter and professional guitar player who commutes between the UK and Germany and is well known in the local music scenes in Weston-Super-Mare and Munich. With connections all around the globe, he has travelled the world with only his music and guitar on his back.</p>
