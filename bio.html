        <h6>Transcribing</h6>
        <p>I use Guitar Pro (a professional tablature editor software) to transcribe sheet music for guitar, bass and other fretted instruments, so get in touch if you are interested in having your own music put into written form.
        <br><br>
        All tabs and sheets that I provide for your guitar lessons are transcribed by ear and 100% accurate. 
        <br><br>
        I can also transcribe any songs into various difficulty levels and adjust them so you can play any song no matter your skill level in either notation or tab, depending on your preference.
